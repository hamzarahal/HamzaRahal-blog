**Statistical Programming**

-   **SAS Programming**: Develop and maintain SAS programs for statistical analysis, dataset creation, and data manipulation.

-   **R Programming**: Use R for statistical modeling, visualizations, and data handling in clinical trials.

-   **Python**: Provide programming support using Python for advanced data science applications, machine learning models, or automation in data processing.

-   **Custom Reporting Tools**: Develop custom scripts to automate the generation of **Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs)** for clinical trial reports.

**Quality Control and Validation**

-   **Double Programming**: Perform independent programming to validate datasets and analysis results, ensuring data integrity.

-   **Validation of Statistical Code**: Conduct validation checks on SAS, R, or Python code for accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility.

**Clinical Data Visualization**

-   **Graphs and Plots**: Create advanced data visualizations (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves, forest plots, waterfall plots, spaghetti plots) to represent clinical trial data.

-   **Interactive Dashboards**: Develop interactive dashboards (using tools like **Shiny** in R or **Power BI**) for clinical teams to explore data in real-time.

**Regulatory Submission Support**

-   **Submission Datasets**: Prepare datasets and documentation in accordance with regulatory standards (e.g., CDISC-compliant datasets) for submissions to the **FDA**, **EMA**, or other regulatory agencies.

-   **Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) / Integrated Summary of Efficacy (ISE)**: Create datasets and perform analyses required for the ISS and ISE sections of the **New Drug Application (NDA)** or **Biologics License Application (BLA)**.

-   **Reviewer’s Guide and Define.XML**: Prepare essential documentation such as the Reviewer’s Guide, Define.XML, and annotated CRFs (Case Report Forms) for regulatory submissions.

**Training and Support**

-   **Programming Workshops**: Provide training sessions or workshops in SAS, R, Python, or CDISC standards for clinical and statistical teams.

-   **Ongoing Statistical Support**: Offer ongoing support for clinical research teams during the trial lifecycle, including troubleshooting, re-analysis, and data interpretation.
